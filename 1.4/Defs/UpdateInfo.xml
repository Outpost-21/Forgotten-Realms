- Adjusted spawn rates to be higher so they spawn a lot more commonly among vanilla factions if that setting is enabled.
- Added support for [NL] Facial Animation, thanks to Mafelusz2 for speeding that up.
- Added racial hediffs to note the differences of each race from standard humans.
- Disabled verbose logging.
- Minor bug fixes and adjustments.

Note: [NL] Facial Animation was only tested alongside the Vanilla Textures Expanded retexture for it, as that is the only reason I was willing to add support at all.
