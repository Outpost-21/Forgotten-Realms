		<content>Version 2.2.1 - 2.2.4
- Fixed typo breaking Killoren settings
- Fixed Killoren and Tabaxi descriptions
- Adjusted some stats slightly for various races
- Added further checks to the butchering patch to deal with cases where a race is butchered that should have a brain but provides nothing else usually
- Added check to brain patch to ensure the bodyDef is Human instead of just checking for a blood, flesh, sentience and a brain specifically to compensate for mods in need of an update.
- Fixed an issue where extracting Illithids brains would do nothing.</content>

		<content>Version 2.2.0
- The Killoren race has been added. Along with appropriate toggles to disable them or their faction. Killoren are herbivores so cannot eat meat, but eat half as often.
- The Tabaxi race has been added. Along with their appropriate toggles to disable them or their faction. Tabaxi are carnivores, but also eat half as often.
- Illithids have been changed so they only need to feed roughly once a season, however they now only eat humanoid brains, which you can get when butchering any applicable humanoid as long as their brain is intact.
- Illithids can now have a surgery performed which extracts their brain, this is how you will obtain an Elder Brain if you don't have one at the start, or if you can't find one or a trader who sells one.
- Illithid Elder Brain item and structure, as well as the tadpole have had their textures updated.

The next major update will add things that require the Vanilla Expanded Framework so that's been added as a requirement.</content>
