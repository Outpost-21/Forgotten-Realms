	<description>[anchor]UpperLeft[/anchor]Your version of Forgotten Realms is now on 2.1.0, old saves should still work as they did before but you will need to set up the mod settings for a new game if you wish to have anything other than the defaults. I won't use this update notice too often, just when I think there are changes substantial enough to warrant getting your attention.
	
The main changes in this update are:
- You can now toggle races entirely or just the factions as before. (all are enabled by default)
- You can now toggle scenarios. (disabled by default)
- You can now toggle race integration, which will allow races to spawn among the vanilla human factions.
- All races have both a tribal and spacer scenario now.
- Half-Orcs can spawn as their own faction now. (Icon is the same as Orcs, no I'm not changing that, just be glad there's even a faction.)
	
Important Notes:
- Changes to settings requires a game restart to properly take effect.
- Never change settings on an existing save, this WILL break the save. Disabled races/factions are completely removed from the game with how the settings now work. 
- If you wish to continue a save from before this update, you can, the factions you had disabled before will still be disabled on that save, but new games will only look at the new settings. Do not disable any of the new settings till you want to start a new game though.</description>
