  <description>[anchor]UpperLeft[/anchor]Your version of Forgotten Realms is now on 2.2.0!
	
What's new?
- The Killoren race has been added. Along with appropriate toggles to disable them or their faction.
- The Tabaxi race has been added. Along with their appropriate toggles to disable them or their faction.
- Illithids have been changed so they only need to feed once a season, however they now only eat humanoid brains, which you can get when butchering any applicable humanoid, much the same as meat.
- Illithids can now have a surgery performed which extracts their brain, this is how you will obtain an Elder Brain if you don't have one at the start, or if you can't find one or a trader who sells one.
- Illithid Elder Brain item and structure, as well as the tadpole have had their textures updated.

It's worth noting this now so you can quit without saving if you wish to disable the new races before continuing. The only time I'll make use of this update log is when an update adds things you may want to disable before continuing so they don't add to your save (preventing you from doing so later safely) and this is one of those times.</description>
