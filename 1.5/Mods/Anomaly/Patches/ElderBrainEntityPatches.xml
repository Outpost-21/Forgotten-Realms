						<text>{PAWN_nameDef} has completed {PAWN_possessive} investigation of the elder brain. {PAWN_pronoun} has discovered that the tadpoles it produces desire to form a bond of some kind, reaching out psychically to entice people to get closer, promising power. The only step remaining is to extract a tadpole from the tank and let it bond with someone to find out what will happen, there's nothing else we can learn from simply observing the elder brain itself.</text>
